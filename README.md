# timelinefix
Fix past timelines by rerouting energy to be focused on the solution of a problem

By creating antimatter at the site of a problem and then constantly creating antimatter over the solution to the problem, creates a neverending stream of
energy flowing backwards towards the problem happening throughout time and creates attention to the solution increasing probability of problem being solved.

Usage: python3 timelinefix.py "problem" "fix"
