# timelinefix
Fix past timelines by rerouting energy to be focused on the solution of a problem

By creating antimatter at the site of a problem and then constantly creating antimatter over the solution to the problem, creates a neverending stream of
energy flowing backwards towards the problem happening throughout time and creates attention to the solution increasing probability of problem being solved.

Based off of Time Police Program for increasing attention to problems occuring in the past.

Usage: python3 timelinefix.py "write problem here" "write solution here"
